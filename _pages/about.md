Previously, I cofounded [Chord](https://chord.pub) ([Neo](https://neo.com) '22) and was a student at Stanford.

In my spare time, I like to [read](/reads), [write](/blog/), and [photo](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0iJtdOXmkYghC).

You might want to see my [projects](https://github.com/kliu128) or
