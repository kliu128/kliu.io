I'm a student at Stanford interested in entrepreneurship, writing joyful
software, and strengthening safety culture in ML. In my spare
time, I like to [read](/reads), [write](/blog/), and [photo](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0iJtdOXmkYghC).

This spring, I'm working on [Chord](https://chordapp.io), an app to improve
intros between friends.

You might want to see my [projects](https://github.com/kliu128) or
[tweets](https://twitter.com/kliu128). Feel free to get in
[contact](mailto:kevin@kliu.io) with me or book a
[call](https://calendly.com/kliu128) for any reason whatsoever.

I'd like to learn more about:

- Programming language theory.
- Trust and safety in large tech companies.
- Chinese.
