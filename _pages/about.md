I'm currently on [Frontier Evals](https://evals.openai.com/) at OpenAI. I'm interested in safely building powerful AI systems, understanding and smoothening the economic impacts of automation, and figuring out how to better appreciate life.

Previously, I cofounded [Chord](https://chord.pub) ([Neo](https://neo.com) '22) and studied CS at Stanford. Right now, I live in San Francisco In my spare time, I like to [read](/reads), [write](/blog/), and [photo](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0iJtdOXmkYghC).

You might want to see my [projects](https://github.com/kliu128) or
