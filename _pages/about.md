Hey there, I'm a student at Stanford interested in joyful software, entrepreneurship, and improving safety culture in machine learning. In my spare
time, I like to [read](/reads), [write](/blog/), and [photo](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0iJtdOXmkYghC). This spring, I'm working with [Sidney](https://shough.me) on Chord, a consumer AI startup.

You might want to see my [projects](https://github.com/kliu128) or
[tweets](https://twitter.com/kliu128). If you have cool thoughts, know the fundamental causes of the 1970s Great Stagnation, or just want to reach out, don't hesitate to contact me through
[e-mail](mailto:kevin@kliu.io) or [videophone](https://calendly.com/kliu128).
