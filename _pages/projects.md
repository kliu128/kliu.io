## Launched

- **[Zero][]** -- my homelab, running a Matrix server, GitLab, Asterisk, and the blog you're currently reading, along with a constellation of other services that I use daily. I run a collection of Ubuntu VMs using [Proxmox][], and run [microk8s][] to deploy my services to Kubernetes.
- **[Circuit Breaker](/apps/circuit-breaker/)** -- A no-nonsense Pomodoro app that enables Focus mode to keep you in the zone. Built using SwiftUI for macOS.

### Research

- **[CLIP Enrichment Circuits](https://seri-win21-circuits.github.io/clip-enrichment-circuits/)**  
  Sidney Hough, Kevin Liu, Jack Ryan, Chelsea Voss  
  _Stanford Existential Risks Initiative_

- **Stanford MLab at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Tree-Based Modelling of Lexical Complexity using Word Embeddings**  
  Erik Rozi, Niveditha Iyer, Gordon Chi, Enok Choe, Kathy J. Lee, Kevin Liu, Patrick Liu, Zander Lack, Jillian Tang, Ethan A. Chi  
  _15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021)_

## Completed & Past Projects

- **[Stanford One for the World (website)](https://onefortheworld.su.domains)** -- a website for the Stanford [One for the World chapter](https://1fortheworld.org/), encouraging students to pledge to donate at least 1% of their income to effective charities. For context, research demonstrates that effective charities can save a life with funding on the order of ~$500-1000. It's crazy how neglected this is.

- **[Delphus](https://delph.us)** -- a trustable research management system. Built using TypeScript, React, and Web3. Commits encrypted data to the Ethereum blockchain to improve scientific transparency and provide data provenance. I worked on this with a [group of other co-founders](https://delph.us/team).

- **[gasleaks.info](https://gasleaks.info)** -- Open access to National Grid, HEET's, and Gas Safety Inc.'s' data on gas leaks in Acton, MA. Natural gas leaks are a major problem in New England's aging infrastructure, and can contribute to ~10% of Massachusetts greenhouse gas emissions. I worked on this project at Resource Force, a club at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School.

- **[Netflix Party Reborn](https://github.com/kliu128/netflix-party-reborn)** -- a lightly-updated fork of Netflix Party to get the extension working properly on modern versions of Firefox.

- **[giffs](https://github.com/kliu128/giffs)** -- a FUSE filesystem that appends a GIF header to every file (in case you ever needed it). Effectively prefixes every file with a given prefix.

- **[cubic20](https://github.com/kliu128/cubic20)** -- an Android app to give reminders every 20 minutes to maintain eye health. Dreadfully out-of-date now, thanks to Android's strict power saving behaviors, but may still be useful.

- **[AB Robotics control code](https://github.com/acton-robotics-team/ftc_app)** for control of an FTC robot.

## Ideas

Feel free to pick one up, and [let me know](/about) how it goes!

- [2020-07-27] A GPT-2/3 persuasion bot. Make GPT-X predict both its output _and the user's response_ several times. Then, use sentiment analysis or another form of ranking to evaluate how convinced the user is of a certain claim from each possible GPT statement. Pick the most convincing one, and repeat.
- [2020-07-08] A web extension to block spiders or other phobia-inducing images from the internet, using a machine learning model. I started working on [Image Begone](https://github.com/kliu128/image-begone) briefly.
