description: the ravings of a crazy pediatrician about systems
---

There's a certain category of book that talks not about factual events or
information, but about _vibes_ -- ways in which to think about the world,
archetypes that slightly tweak your inner neural predictor rather than create a
hard decision boundary. This is definitely one of them. Also, it's super meme,
which makes it even better.

The vibes that this book espouses:

1. Complex systems are all around us. They're watching you. Right now.

2. **Nonlinear causality**. Simple or "obvious" interventions are likely to backfire in the worst way
   possible. People usually think in linear cause-and-effect, but in fact the
   real world often operates counterintuitively and according to [nonlinear
   causality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76JRJ90s548).

3. **Intrasystem goals**. Systems will take on their own goals, and they will conspire against you. A
   performance management system is likely to backfire because of unavoidable
   distortion of incentives (instead of working, I'm writing my performance
   review or OKRs).

4. **Big systems are different**. Systems qualitatively change in behavior when they expand by an order of
   magnitude. See [scaling large distributed
   systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/ch01.html),
   [ML grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10343),
   [highways](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-2017/the-access-almanac-traffic-congestion-is-counter-intuitive-and-fixable/).

5. **Winning**. In very obscure edge cases, you can gain an upper hand on the system and win.
   No easy trick is given for this, likely because the solution requires a
   bundle of good heuristics rather than an [expert
   rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system). However, it's often
   easier to win when you arrange things such that [victory becomes the default
   path rather than requiring effort](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-19-on-systems-living-a-life-of-zero-willpower), like a [gravity assist versus a direct
   transfer maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist).

I'd like to read more books that espouse vibes rather than facts, especially
books that support vibes by giving a diversity of examples like this one.

> A COMPLEX SYSTEM DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH NEVER WORKS AND CANNOT BE MADE TO WORK.
> YOU HAVE TO START OVER, BEGINNING WITH A WORKING SIMPLE SYSTEM.

> In brief, there can be NO SYSTEM WITHOUT ITS OBSERVER and NO OBSERVATION
> WITHOUT ITS EFFECTS.
