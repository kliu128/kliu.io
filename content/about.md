Hi! I'm a high school student who likes to program. This is my website, where I self-host various services that you can find in the upper header.

If you want to contact me, please do at (in order of preference):

- Matrix: [@kevin:potatofrom.space](https://matrix.to/#/@kevin:potatofrom.space)
- Email: [kevin@kliu.io](mailto:kevin@kliu.io)
- Fediverse: [@kevin@potatofrom.space](https://fedi.potatofrom.space/@kevin)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-kevin-liu/)

You can find the source code of this blog [here](https://gitlab.kliu.io/kevin/potatofrom.space).

## GPG Key

Use this for encrypted email conversations with me. (I would prefer something more like Matrix, though, if possible.)

$ gpg --fingerprint --list-keys kevin@potatofrom.space
