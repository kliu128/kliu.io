Hi! I'm an incoming undergraduate student at Stanford. This is my blog, where I sporadically post interesting programming (and occasionally other) tidbits.

## Contact

I'm always open to talk about novel project ideas, programming questions, or anything else. I'm on [Matrix](https://matrix.org) at [@kevin:kliu.io](https://matrix.to/#/@kevin:kliu.io), but you'll probably find it easiest to [email me](mailto:kevin@kliu.io). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kliu128), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/kliu128), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/kliu128), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/the-kevin-liu).
