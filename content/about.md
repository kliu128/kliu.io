Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at Stanford, majoring in CS with an interest in AI and systems. I write this blog to share useful tidbits with a broader audience and to meet new people.

## Talk to me 

I'm always open to hang out, discuss new ideas, or to meet up if you're in the Stanford area. Feel free to [schedule a meeting with me](https://calendly.com/kliu128/45min) at any time, even (especially) if we haven't met before!

If you want to reach out via text, I'm on:

- Email: [kevin@kliu.io](mailto:kevin@kliu.io)
- Matrix: [@kevin:kliu.io](https://matrix.to/#/@kevin:kliu.io)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kliu128), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/kliu128), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/kliu128), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/the-kevin-liu)
