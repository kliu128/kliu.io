Here are objects I like. It feels to me that having good objects is underrated.

General rules I follow:

- It's okay to pay for something if it gives you more value than however-much-the-subscription costs.
- Minimize _unnecessary_ physical objects, but don't be afraid of having good ones around.

## Other People's Objects

Other people have good objects, too. Many of them are probably better than mine. An incomplete list:

- [Mark Xu's objects](https://markxu.com/things)
- [Alexey Guzey's objects](https://guzey.com/tools-gear/)
- [New York Times: Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/)

(I wonder if there should be a central list for this, or something.)

## The Physical

Physical objects are very annoying. They have to be moved, stored, gotten from another room, etc. But _some_ of them are worth it.

### Technology

- [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) for wireless earbuds that don't hurt my ears over time
- [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/) + [Pencil](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation) + [a paper-like screen protector](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYY1DDZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for Anki, scratch writing, and RemNote review (currently)
- Kindle for reading (coupled with Calibre + USB transfer for ebooks)
  - I have the Kindle KT7, but there are better models these days.
- [Spectre C35](https://smile.amazon.com/Sceptre-C355W-3440UN-Super-Curved-Ultrawide/dp/B0812DKDD9?sa-no-redirect=1) for an external montior
  - There are better monitors out there, but this one was a nice balance of cost and performance for me.
- [Magnetic USB-C adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6NGBC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) to make plugging in and out ridiculously convenient
- [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) for an incredibly quality keyboard that doesn't squish my hands
  - Note: nowadays the [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) might be a better choice.
  - With [Kailh Box Jade](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-clicks) switches for extra clickability
- [Logitech G602](https://smile.amazon.com/Logitech-Lag-Free-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00E4MQODC) for a fairly speedy wireless mouse
- [Flexispot Motorized Standing Desk Converter](https://smile.amazon.com/FlexiSpot-Motorized-Standing-Converter-Adjustable/dp/B08CC4DDGK/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=flexispot+motorized&qid=1620153688&s=office-products&sr=1-4) for an effective standing desk that can fit in a dorm
- A good USB-C hub for a desk setup where you can plug in and out with just one cable
- A USB charging station with enough ports to top off every single device I own at a time

### Potential Future Things

- A [Lumenator](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator) to make the room look like daylight

## The Digital

A note: many of these apps are Apple products-only. This is kind of unfortunate. I suspect there are alternatives that are about as good on Windows, though.

### Productivity

- [Krisp](https://krisp.ai) for never having to worry about noise in video calls again
- Linux-only:
  - [i3](https://i3wm.org/) for an efficient tiling window manager. ([Sway](https://swaywm.org/) is another option, but Wayland still has a lot of rough edges wrt screen sharing and cursor lag, so I wouldn't recommend unless it's required, e.g. for a mixed DPI setup.)
    - [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) for a powerful snipping tool
    - [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) for making screens nicer in the dark
    - [kitti3](https://github.com/LandingEllipse/kitti3) for a quake-style dropdown terminal in i3
    - [xidlehook](https://github.com/jD91mZM2/xidlehook) for a better idle locker daemon
  - [PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects) + [Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) for noise suppression that's only *slightly* buggier and lower quality than Krisp

- macOS-only:
  - [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for a low-effort and pretty way to capture tasks
    - Shout out to Emacs Org Mode, though, which I used for several years prior.
  - [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/) for a slightly faster Spotlight
  - [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for fixing macOS's insane keyboard problems
  - [SensibleSideButtons](https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net/) to fix the forward/back buttons on my mouse
  - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for window hotkeys
  - [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/) for making drag and drop ridiculously easy
  - [MultiTimer](https://multitimer.net/) for naming timers and counters


### Notetaking

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for learning a language (currently Chinese!)
- [RemNote](https://remnote.io) for a powerful knowledge base and amazing flashcard system
  - I tried [Roam](https://roamresearch.com). It was okay, but it felt kind of cobbled-together (markdown? paste random js into your editor to add plugins? no spaced repetition by default?). RemNote is definitely buggier, but I feel that it wins out just because it seems like it got the data structure _right_.
- [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) for queuing things to be read later without getting distracted in the moment
- **[Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com/)** for amazing screenshot-to-LaTeX abilities
- macOS-only:
  - [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) for handwritten notetaking
  - Apple Books for a book syncing system that works well enough
    - I also used to use Calibre, but I realized that I don't really need all of its complexity.

### Development

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for basically all coding
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API development that's actually kind of nice
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for connecting to local servers from anywhere
- macOS-only:
  - [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) for a speedy terminal
  - [Homebrew](https://homebrew.sh) for installing things quickly

### Chat

- [Element](https://element.io) for an open-source, end-to-end encrypted chat application with nice UX

### Fun

- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for nice music

## Historical

Things I used to have, but no longer do. They might still be good for you, though.

- MacBook Pro (M1, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for an incredible-quality computer
  - I really enjoyed the performance and battery life, but ultimately, it didn't "spark joy" since I disagree with Apple's philosophy against user control.
