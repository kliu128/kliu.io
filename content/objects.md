Here are objects I like. It feels to me that having good objects is underrated.

General rules I follow:

- It's okay to pay for something if it gives you more value than however-much-the-subscription costs.
- Minimize _unnecessary_ physical objects, but don't be afraid of having good ones around.

## Other People's Objects

Other people have good objects, too. Many of them are probably better than mine. An incomplete list:

- [Mark Xu's objects](https://markxu.com/things)
- [Alexey Guzey's objects](https://guzey.com/tools-gear/)
- [New York Times: Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/)

## The Physical

Physical objects are very annoying. They have to be moved, stored, gotten from another room, etc. But _some_ of them are worth it.

### Technology

- MacBook Pro (M1, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for an incredible-quality computer
  - I didn't like Apple products for a long time. Then I actually tried one, and, well. Here we are.
- AirPods Pro for wireless earbuds that don't hurt my ears over time
- iPad + Pencil + Paperlike case for distraction-free reading, Anki, and RemNote review (currently)
- [Spectre C35](https://smile.amazon.com/Sceptre-C355W-3440UN-Super-Curved-Ultrawide/dp/B0812DKDD9?sa-no-redirect=1) for an external montior
  - There are better monitors out there, but this one was a nice balance of cost and performance for me.
- A good USB-C hub for a desk setup where you can plug in and out with just one cable
- [Magnetic USB-C adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6NGBC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) to make plugging in and out ridiculously convenient
- [POK3R keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165) for a good keyboard that doesn't hurt my hands

### Potential Future Things

- A standing desk converter for normal desks
- A weighted blanket
- A [Lumenator](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator) to make the room look like daylight

## The Digital

A note: many of these apps are Apple products-only. This is kind of unfortunate. I suspect there are alternatives that are about as good on Windows, though.

### Productivity

- Google Chrome for a web browser that just works ([although](https://uxdesign.cc/mozilla-firefox-google-chrome-monopoly-microsoft-internet-explorer-edge-netscape-navigator-56727b258f54))
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for a low-effort and pretty way to capture tasks
  - Shout out to Emacs Org Mode, though, which I used for several years prior.
- [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/) for a slightly faster Spotlight
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for fixing macOS's insane keyboard problems
- [Krisp](https://krisp.ai) for never having to worry about noise in video calls again
- [SensibleSideButtons](https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net/) to fix the forward/back buttons on my mouse
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for window hotkeys
- [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/) for making drag and drop ridiculously easy
- [MultiTimer](https://multitimer.net/) for naming timers and counters

### Notetaking

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for learning a language (currently Chinese!)
- [RemNote](https://remnote.io) for a powerful knowledge base and amazing flashcard system
  - I tried [Roam](https://roamresearch.com). It was okay, but it felt kind of cobbled-together (markdown? paste random js into your editor to add plugins? no spaced repetition by default?). RemNote is definitely buggier, but I feel that it wins out just because it seems like it got the data structure _right_.
- [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) for queuing things to be read later without getting distracted in the moment
- [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) for handwritten notetaking
- Apple Books for a book syncing system that works well enough
  - I also used to use Calibre, but I realized that I don't really need all of its complexity.

### Development

- [Homebrew](https://homebrew.sh) for installing things quickly
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for basically all coding
- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) for a speedy terminal
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API development that's actually kind of nice
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for connecting to local servers from anywhere

### Chat

- [Element](https://element.io) for an open-source, end-to-end encrypted chat application with nice UX

### Fun

- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for nice music
