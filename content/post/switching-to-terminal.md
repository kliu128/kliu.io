You may have noticed that the site looks a little different. That's because it's now using the amazing [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) made by `panr`!

Fun fact: panr's theme also powers my friend's new blog at [atypical.ml](https://atypical.ml).

I first saw this theme on [kalbas.it](https://kalbas.it/)'s blog, and thought it looked quite nice. So here we are.
